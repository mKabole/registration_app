# registration_app
The following is the documentation for the React application designed to manage children's information. This application offers a seamless experience for registering children, viewing a list of said children and accessing each childâ€™s individual profile. The application has a user-friendly interface and easy-to-use features. The app is backed by a node.js API and an SQLite database. This app streamlines the process of capturing essential details such as names, ages, genders, and immunizations, enabling easy organization and access to vital child-related information.
